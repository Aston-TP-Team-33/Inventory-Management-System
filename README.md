# Inventory-Management-System
## Summary 
This is the Inventory Management System for Galaxy Gadget. This was created using Java, JavaFX and Scene Builder.

## Features
The JavaFX application allows admin users to interact with our database. Admins can create, update and delete users, update & delete orders, manage products, view user 
queries and generate a report for a summary of the current status of orders and products.

The application features a side navigation bar for ease of use. Each page has a form on the left side of the page where you can fill in the data for the item you'd like 
to create or update. By clicking on an item in the table the form will autofill with its information. You can then hit either the create button (certain information that doesn't
allow duplicates will need to change e.g username), update button which will update the selected item or delete button which will remove it from the database.

The report page has a generate button which, when clicked, will create a pdf in the root directory of the project. 

The project is only open to admins so customer accoutns will not be able to access the system.
